# WordTsar

Wordstar for the 21st Century. WordTsar is a Wordstar 7.0D document mode clone. It loads Wordstar 4, Wordstar 7, RTF (partial), and DOCX(partial) files, and saves in Wordstar 7 and RTF format.

WordTsar is currently Alpha. What does Alpha mean? Alpha means the program works, but is feature incomplete. Please do not send reports on non-implemented features. Feel free to discuss them in the forum though.

More details in each release subfolder.

 
*__NOTE:__ for people submitting support/bugs. Please include only one bug/issue per ticket. Multiple issues per ticket is a pain to manage for me. Windows Users: unzip the file and read the readme.txt.*
