# WordTsar

Wordstar for the 21st Century. WordTsar is a Wordstar 7.0D document mode clone. It loads Wordstar 4, Wordstar 7, RTF (partial), and DOCX(partial) files, and saves in Wordstar 7 and RTF format.

WordTsar is currently Alpha. What does Alpha mean? Alpha means the program works, but is feature incomplete. Please do not send reports on non-implemented features. Feel free to discuss them in the forum though.

(2024-04-15) This is version **0.3.1116 pre-Alpha** *(see below)* for Windows, Linux and MacOS.

__This release is not for general consumption__

The Windows build is compiled on Windows 10 and is dynamically linked with QT using Visual Studio 2022, and is 64 bit.  

This is considerred to be an untested, not neccesarily stable release. Save often.

__NEW__

- Codepage 737 support, and all the stuff that goes with it.
- There are also multiple core changes that may not be ready for the light of day


__NOTES__

- 0.3.1116 has not been extensively tested.
- A backup of your file is made every 1 minute (in WordTsar 7.0 format). 
- The initial page/paper size is 8.5" x 11"
 
*__NOTE:__ for people submitting support/bugs. Please include only one bug/issue per ticket. Multiple issues per ticket is a pain to manage for me. Windows Users: unzip the file and read the readme.txt.*
